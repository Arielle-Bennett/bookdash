# Book Dash, November 2024 Report

## The Turing Way Book Dash, 4-8 November 2024: Overview and Report

The Turing Way Book Dash events are a less intense version of Book Sprints, where participants collaboratively work on The Turing Way guides synchronously to develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date. They also contribute to enhancing the project by improving the ways we work in the community and take lead on accomplishing different tasks or subprojects.

## Format of the event

The November 2024 edition of Book Dash featured 37 contributors, 10 committee members, 20 online working sessions, four discussions and social events, and two community share-outs. We used [the checklists](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3367) for day/session leads to ensure the planning committee was prepared to host the event. 

Since November 2020, the Book Dashes have been hosted mostly online with multiple short co-working called development sessions spread over five days for flexible participation by members. This format allows people in different time zones to participate with the same efficiency and equitable support.

This involved creating shared documents with all the information, providing support funds to ensure that everyone can comfortably participate and hosting a pre-event calls to communicate these resources to everyone.

Similar to the previous Book Dashes in 2022 and 2023, we also had a local hub hosted in London at The Alan Turing Institute with modifications introduced for the in-person participants to plan their day offline. A TU Delft local hub was organised thanks to funding from the [Open Science NL Open Science event fund](https://www.openscience.nl/en/calls/open-science-meetings). 

## Application, Review and Selection process

As in the past, we invited applications through an open call where interested applicants could state their goals and interest in the Book Dash. Previous attendees and long-term members of the community were also invited to sign up as mentors for new contributors and session leads as part of the application process.

Applicants were asked to describe what they wanted to contribute to the Turing Way during the Book Dash, and how they would collaborate and engage with other participants. To get a sense of the time zones these applicants came from, we asked them to choose their preferred slots. In the future, we should also ask them about their preferred language for communication so that we can plan sessions in languages other than English as well.
    
The Book Dash Planning Committee used the rubrics to score the applications during the review. They met online to discuss applications, frame feedback and conclude their selection process.

## Our attendees also led and participated in the following informal discussions and public events: 
* **Image-a-thon** Arielle Bennett and Emma Karoune kicked off the social sessions with a session on adding images into the book.
    * Participants were given templates and guidelines to help them insert Scriberia images from the archive into the book with alt text.
    * Participants were also encouraged to review existing images alt-text to identify if it needed revising. 
    * Updates made as part of the session include: 
        * Research Data Management chapters: four images alt-text revised 
        * Code Styling chapter: one image added, another alt-text revised
        * Practitioner's Hub chapter: revised alt-text for one image
        * Research Data Management repository chapter: added one new image with alt-text
        * Research Data Management storage chapter: typos fixed in alt-text
        * Research Data Management metadata chapter: typos fixed in alt-text
* Meme Workshop: Tuesday with Sinem Görücü of Feminist Design
* Kirstie Whitaker led the 'Show and Tell' lunch session.
* Patricia Loto led the 'Show and Tell' session for Spanish speakers on Wednesday
* Discussion about the [UNESCO Draft principles of open science monitoring](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/call-inputs-global-consultation-draft-principles-open-science-monitoring) led by Emma Karoune. This has been written up as [a submission](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14274759) to the call for contribution.
* Two Community Share-outs were hosted by Anne Lee Steele and Arielle Bennett and Liz Hare, where Book Dash participants shared with the rest of the community and fellow Book Dash Participants what they were focused on during the week, where help was needed and to celebrate their collective achievements.

## Feedback
At the end of the event, we asked our participants to share feedback anonymously in the “Pluses and Deltas”. We greatly appreciate the work that our attendees have accomplished in the project during this short event and thank them for their feedback, a few of which have been highlighted below.

### Pluses
* I really enjoyed the Delft hub as an opportunity to see people that I don't see on regular basis. It was a very friendly and inspiring gathering with food and coffee. It was great to see that some people contribute for the first time! Esther did a great introduction and made us all feel comfortable and welcome.
* It was a new experience for me. I am so excited about my first contributions on fixing the Research objects chapter. It was great connecting with likely minded people. Esther gave a warm welcome, great introduction to the Book Dash and kept us comfortable throughout the event. I loved the event and would like to go for more.
* As an organizer I enjoyed supporting a Spanish social session, and hope we can keep supporting participation in other languages.
* Synchronous coworking can get decisions made quickly.
* What I liked the most was that everyone was eager to help and explain things. I felt really welcomed and part of this amazing community. 
* Great social sessions and a very friendly community.
* Lots of opportunities to share knowledge, help other people or learn.
* I really enjoyed the opportunity to step away from my usual working style—it was a refreshing change and a welcome break from the routine. 
* It was also great to connect with group of people with such varied expertise and interests which lead to some very meaningful conversations.
* As a newbie to both the Turing Way and Book Dash I appreciated the friendly and supportive approach from all the staff who organised/delivered the pre-Book Dash and Book Dash events.
* As an organiser, I really enjoyed running the Spanish social session, and I hope it will be held again in the next edition.

### Deltas
* Combining physical and online bookdash remains tricky for me. It feels like missing out on the special atmosphere of the online one when I join the one in person. I really don't know how to go about this because having the in-person one on another moment would be tricky - there won't be cool workshops from the online bookdash, no community share-outs.
* Anne brought up with me that we need to do accessibility planning for in-person hubs. We need to ask participants if there are barriers for them *after* providing information about the accessibility of the venues. This would include wheelchair accessibility (insluding restrooms), quiet spaces, gender-inclusive rest rooms, navigation and signage, dietary restrictions and probably that I can't think of at the moment. 
* I noticed that some newcomers were a bit lost in the beginning and did not know where to start, so maybe having more 'good-first' issues and pull requests would help.
* It would be nice to have a Zoom room on the last day, aside from the share-outs for remote participants to hang out in  +
* Hmmm, not sure. I had missed the memo about food expenses, so I would encourage participants to take advantage of this on day 1 and enjoy a nice lunch or coffee. Maybe a slack thread of tasty treats....  +
* I felt that some participants were a bit lost on how to start contributing to the book dash, especially during the first few days.

## Changes Suggested for future Book Dashes
After the Book Dash week, the Planning Committee met to review the general feedback; pluses and deltas and discuss any changes that should implemented in the upcoming Book Dash:
* Consider accessibility in all the planning stages. As a hybrid event we need to ensure that anyone joining online and in-person is accessible, including dietary requirements, internet, etc 
* Reinforce the communication about the food expenses from the start so that people can plan and use appropriately.
* Clearer roadmap for beginners to start with during Book Dash (maybe an onboarding room with easy to start to issues) - during the onboarding have them identify a starting issue.
* Not just have informations in emails, also have the documentation elsewhere.
* Share-out suggestions for Book Dash 2025:
    * How to build your personal website, GitHub profile, session to teach people how to set up your personal website (idea for a social session in the future). 

### Follow up actions

**Planning stage:**
* Promote the international hub using the Roadmap to international hub hosting, so that hubs can be planned in advance. 
* [Provide more context of the responsibilities and tasks for the planning committee](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3348), times and better context for anyone joining the planning committee: 
* Consider to host another session so that people can just hang out and chill.  
* Reinforce the communication about the food expenses from the start so that people can plan and use appropriately
* Facilitate an onboarding room with easy to start to issues for new-joiners
* Communicate clearer that the GitHub workshop is not just GitHub, also how The Turing Way works
* Update the [ongoing issue for guidance](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3367) and/or landing page!
- Update the [checklist for day hosts and session hosts](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/2494).
- Pre-made rooms on zoom were helpful for some, not helpful for others as many stayed in the main room. Further action is required for them to be more integrated (i.e. discussed on Day 1 of Book Dash)
- Newcomers would benefit for more onboarding activities and icebreakers hosted on Day 1 of Book Dash apart from usual onboarding
