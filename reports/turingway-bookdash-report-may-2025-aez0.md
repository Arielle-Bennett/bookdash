## **The Turing Way Book Dash, 15, 20-22 May: Overview and Report**

The Turing Way Book Dash events are a less intense version of Book Sprints, where participants collaboratively work on The Turing Way guides synchronously to develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date. They also contribute to enhancing the project by improving the ways we work in the community and take lead on accomplishing different tasks or subprojects.

## 

## **Highlights**

   * We hosted a virtual scavenger hunt where participants where given 5 minutes to grab items that address certain given categories. Points were allocated to the fastest participants, each item that ticked a category and most interesting items. Congratulations to Sara Villa and Richard Action for winning the scavenger hunt!
   * After many years inviting an illustrator from Scriberia to the Book Dash, we didn't have one in this edition.  This gave the opportunity to many contributors to focus on making our library of images more accessible, reviewing alt-texts, and making them searchable through key words. 
   * We explored using technologies and methods for low-resource settings as some members of the DSWB community had issues using zoom due to internet connectivity. For example, using whatsapp to communicate and check-in periodically with them.  Members also mostly worked on their contributions async, with periodic check-ins to guide them and point them in the right direction. We had members who made their changes on google docs, then invited reviews, and transferred to GitHub issues when ready. 
   * Adjusting to fit this demographic was a different experience for us, and also a great consideration for future book dashes.
   * An additional consideration for future book dashes as a result of involvement from multi-cultural communties, is to provide multi-lingual support from the application process, to the actual event.
   * Having a part of the Book Dash during Collaborations Workshop 25 gave us the opportunity to interact as an in-person hub and also promoted nice motivation for the online days the following week.

## **Format of the event **

The May 2025 edition of Book Dash featured 32 contributors, 14 committee members, 8 online working sessions, two social events, and two community share-outs. We used [the checklists]([https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3367)](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3367)) for day/session leads to ensure the planning committee was prepared to host the event. 

Since November 2020, the Book Dashes have been hosted mostly online with multiple short co-working called development sessions spread over five days for flexible participation by members. For this Book Dash however, the Committee decided to explore a different format. An initial Hack Day for contributions was held as part of Collaborations Workshop 2025, supported by the Software Sustainability Institute. The following week, two days of online contributions were open to the whole community as usual. 

This involved creating shared documents with all the information, embedding accessibility practices everyone can comfortably participate and hosting pre-event calls to onboard people to the project, set goals, and begin connecting.



## **Application, Review and Selection process**

For the online part of the Book Dash taking place on 20-22 May, we followed a similar process as previous years. We invited applications through an open call where interested applicants could state their goals and interest in the Book Dash. Previous attendees and long-term members of the community were also invited to sign up as mentors for new contributors and session leads as part of the application process.

Applicants were asked to describe what they wanted to contribute to the Turing Way during the Book Dash, and how they would collaborate and engage with other participants. To get a sense of the time zones these applicants came from, we asked them to choose their preferred slots. In the future, we should also ask them about their preferred language for communication so that we can plan sessions in languages other than English as well.

The Book Dash Planning Committee used the rubrics to score the applications during the review. They met online to discuss applications, frame feedback and conclude their selection process.

This book dash, we had members of the Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) join the event. They went through similar application process as other applicants, with Precious, their community manager acting as a link between the Turing Way and DSWB, ensuring all information was passed and properly disseminated.

\_This section looks at chapters that were revised and updated during the May 2025 Book Dash. Other pull requests are still in progress.\_



**Pathway curation**

   * Community management pathways were curated by several members of the team and published during this event: CM Concepts ( [https://book.the-turing-way.org/pathways/pathways-community-management-concepts)](https://book.the-turing-way.org/pathways/pathways-community-management-concepts)) and CM How-to ([https://book.the-turing-way.org/pathways/pathways-community-management-operations)](https://book.the-turing-way.org/pathways/pathways-community-management-operations)). 
   * A new pathway on Data stewards was curated by Esther Plomp and added to the main list ([https://book.the-turing-way.org/pathways/pathways-data-stewards)](https://book.the-turing-way.org/pathways/pathways-data-stewards)). 


Precious Onyewuchi created case studies for the** pathway creation chapter **([https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/pathways/pathways-example)](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/pathways/pathways-example)) .



**Project Management Frameworks Overview**

Arielle Bennet reviewed and completed a chapter on project management frameworks ([https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/project-management-methodologies/overview)](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/project-management-methodologies/overview))

### **Feedback**

*This section copies across from *[https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/ttw-bookdash-may25-feedback](*https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/ttw-bookdash-may25-feedback*)* and incorporates our discussions from the final planning committee meeting- delete once completed*

At the end of the event, we asked our participants to share feedback anonymously in the “Pluses and Deltas”. We greatly appreciate the work that our attendees have accomplished in the project during this short event and thank them for their feedback, a few of which have been highlighted below.

### 

### **Pluses** 

   * Participants found the two-day online event energetic, inclusive, and well-organized. 
   * Social activities, particularly the scavenger hunt, were highly enjoyable and helped build a friendly, welcoming atmosphere. 
   * Continuous host presence, collaborative activities like the image gallery, and multiple ways to contribute (including for those with limited time or bandwidth) were appreciated. 
   * Attendees valued the focus on improving existing resources, especially around images and accessibility, rather than starting new projects. 
   * Overall, the event provided strong support, opportunities to both give and receive help, and an enjoyable, productive environment.


### **Deltas**

   * Participants highlighted the need for greater inclusivity, particularly for those with limited internet access or who prefer languages other than English. Suggestions included collecting preferred language data at registration and integrating onboarding with the translation working group.
   * Some felt the shorter event format limited the ability to contribute more substantial work, especially for those in facilitation roles who had less time to actively participate. 
   * Planning committee members noted challenges in balancing facilitation and contribution, and recommended more hosts and better onboarding to mitigate this.
   * There was a desire for earlier and broader communication, especially via social media, to increase awareness and participation. 
   * Attendees also missed elements like the Scriberia illustrator and in-person interactions, though some found they were more productive in the virtual format


## **Changes Suggested for future Book Dashes**

   * Collecting preferred language data at registration and onboarding with the translation working group, if possible.
   * For planning committee members, clarify that their contributions this time will be more related to coordinations and facilitation than new chapters to the book or invite more hosts to be part of the facilitation session
   * Keep the shorter version of the Book dash, as it allows people to focus more on their contributions without getting burnout. 


### **Follow up actions**

   * In the registration form, to join the November's Book Dash, add a question about the preferred language and highlight that we will try to invite team members from the translation team for the onboarding session
   * Recruit facilitators for Book Dash sessions to allow planning committee members to have more time for their work contributions
