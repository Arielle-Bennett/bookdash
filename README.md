# The Turing Way Book Dash ðŸ“šðŸ’¨

This repository is being used to document processes and decisions made for *The Turing Way* Book Dash.

The Book Dash is a week long hackathon where participants collaboratively work on *The Turing Way* book synchronously to develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date. 
Participants also contribute to enhancing the project by improving the ways we work in the community and take the lead on accomplishing different tasks or sub-projects.
